Samuel Montero-Hernandez is a postdoctoral fellow at the University of Houston. His research is 
focused on the design of algorithms for data analysis and causal discovery using functional near-infrared 
spectroscopy (fNIRS) modality. He possesses comprehensive experience in a range of areas such as 
functional and effective brain connectivity analysis, data quality assurance, and probabilistic graphical 
models.Alice
